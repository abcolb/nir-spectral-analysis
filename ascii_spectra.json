The library contains spectra measured with laboratory, field, and airborne spectrometers. The instruments used cover wavelengths from the ultraviolet to the far infrared (0.2 to 200 microns). Laboratory samples of specific minerals, plants, chemical compounds, and man-made materials were measured. In many cases, samples were purified, so that unique spectral features of a material can be related to its chemical structure. These spectro-chemical links are important for interpreting remotely sensed data collected in the field or from an aircraft or spacecraft. This library also contains physically-constructed as well as mathematically-computed mixtures. Measurements of rocks, soils, and natural mixtures of minerals have also been made with laboratory and field spectrometers. Spectra of plant components and vegetation plots, comprising many plant types and species with varying backgrounds, are also in this library. Measurements by airborne spectrometers are included for forested vegetation plots, in which the trees are too tall for measurement by a field spectrometer.<br>\n<br>\nThe related U.S. Geological Survey Data Series publication, \"USGS Spectral Library Version 7\", describes the instruments used, metadata descriptions of spectra and samples, and possible artifacts in the spectral measurements (Kokaly and others, 2017).<br>\n<br>\nFour different spectrometer types were used to measure spectra in the library:\n<ol>\n\t<li>Beckman™ 5270 covering the spectral range 0.2 to 3 µm<\u002fli>\n\t<li>Standard, high resolution (hi-res), and high-resolution Next Generation (hi-resNG) models of ASD field portable spectrometers covering the range from 0.35 to 2.5 µm<\u002fli>\n\t<li>Nicolet™ Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) interferometer spectrometers covering the range from about 1.12 to 216 µm<\u002fli>\n\t<li>NASA Airborne Visible/Infra-Red Imaging Spectrometer AVIRIS, covering the range 0.37 to 2.5 µm<\u002fli>\n<\u002fol>\n<br>\nTwo fundamental spectrometer characteristics significant for interpreting and utilizing spectral measurements are sampling position (the wavelength position of each spectrometer channel) and bandpass (a parameter describing the wavelength interval over which each channel in a spectrometer is sensitive). Bandpass is typically reported as the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) response at each channel (in wavelength units, for example nm or micron). The linked publication (Kokaly and others, 2017), includes a comparison plot of the various spectrometers used to measure the data in this release. Data for the sampling positions and the bandpass values (for each channel in the spectrometers) are included in this data release. These data are in the SPECPR files, as separate data records, and in the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) text files, as separate files for wavelength and bandpass.<br>\n<br>\nSpectra are provided in files of ASCII text format (files with a .txt file extension). In the ASCII files, deleted channels (bad bands) are indicated by a value of -1.23e<sup>34<\u002fsup>. Metadata descriptions of samples, field areas, spectral measurements, and results from supporting material analyses – such as XRD – are provided in HyperText Markup Language HTML formatted ASCII text files (files with .html file extension). In addition, Graphics Interchange Format (GIF) images of plots of spectra are provided. For each spectrum a plot with wavelength in microns on the x-axis is provided. For spectra measured on the Nicolet spectrometer, an additional GIF image with wavenumber on the x-axis is provided.<br>\n<br>\nData are also provided in SPECtrum Processing Routines (SPECPR) format (Clark, 1993) which packages spectra and associated metadata descriptions into a single file (see the linked publication, Kokaly and others, 2017, for additional details on the SPECPR format and freely-available software than can be used to read files in SPECPR format).<br>\n<br>\nThe data measured on the source spectrometers are denoted by the “splib07a” tag in filenames. In addition to providing the original measurements, the spectra have been convolved and resampled to different spectrometer and multispectral sensor characteristics. The following list specifies the identifying tag for the measured and convolved libraries and gives brief descriptions of the sensors.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>splib07a <\u002fstrong>– this is the name of the SPECPR file containing the spectra measured on the Beckman, ASD, Nicolet and AVIRIS spectrometers. The data are provided with their original sampling positions (wavelengths) and bandpass values. The prefix “splib07a_” is at the beginning of the ASCII and GIF files pertaining to the measured spectra.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>splib07b <\u002fstrong>– this is the name of the SPECPR file containing a modified version of the original measurements. The results from using spectral convolution to convert measurements to other spectrometer characteristics can be improved by oversampling (increasing sample density). Thus, splib07b is an oversampled version of the library, computed using simple cubic-spline interpolation to produce spectra with fine sampling interval (therefore a higher number of channels) for Beckman and AVIRIS measurements. The spectra in this version of the library are the data used to create the convolved and resampled versions of the library.

The bandpass values of each channel were determined by comparing measurements of reference materials made on ASD spectrometers in comparison to measurements made of the same materials on higher resolution spectrometers (the procedure is described in Kokaly, 2011, and discussed in Kokaly and Skidmore, 2015, and Kokaly and others, 2017).

The SPECPR files mentioned previously contain the resampled spectra along with their associated metadata descriptions. The filenames of these alternative SPECPR files are similar to those listed previously, except all characters are in lowercase.<br>\n<br>\nThe spectra in the data release are organized in these chapters:\n<ul>\n\t<li>Chapter M = Minerals<\u002fli>\n\t<li>Chapter S = Soils (including rocks, and mineral mixtures)<\u002fli>\n\t<li>Chapter C = Coatings<\u002fli>\n\t<li>Chapter L = Liquids (including mixtures of liquids, water and other volatiles, and frozen volatiles)<\u002fli>\n\t<li>Chapter O = Organics (including biochemical constituents of plants and chemical compounds)<\u002fli>\n\t<li>Chapter A = Artificial (manmade materials, including construction materials, fabrics, manufactured chemicals, processed materials, paint pigments, plastics, and materials introduced into the environment by human activity)<\u002fli>\n\t<li>Chapter V = Vegetation (including biological materials, plant components such as leaves, flowers, and bark, vegetated areas having more than one species present, lichens, biological soil crusts, and mixtures with vegetation)<\u002fli>\n<\u002ful>\n<br>\nChapter M includes native elements and minerals from arsenate, borate, carbonate, halide, hydroxide, nitrate, oxide, phosphate, silicate (cyclosilicate, inosilicate, phyllosilicate, nesosilicate, sorosilicate, and tectosilicate), sulfate, and sulfide classes are represented. The chapter also contains compositional end- and intermediate-members for the olivine, garnet, scapolite, montmorillonite, muscovite, jarosite, and alunite solid-solution series. We have included representative spectra of kerogen, ammonium-bearing minerals, Lanthanide element oxides, desert varnish coatings, kaolinite crystallinity series, kaolinite-smectite series, zeolite series, and an extensive evaporite series. In some cases, a number of spectra span a compositional solid-solution series or a grain-size series or both.<br>\n<br>\nSome samples were not easily placed into a specific chapter. For example, pure minerals are often difficult to find, or it may be difficult to process the sample to purify the mineral. Such a sample could be considered a mixture. Some samples of this type were put in the minerals chapter (Chapter 1: M) because they have spectral features that are representative of one mineral in the sample. The mixture chapter (Chapter 2: S) contains spectra of multiphase samples used for identifying and mapping mixtures. Usually, the materials in these mixtures have overlapping absorption features in their spectra.<br>\n<br>\nThe samples in the coatings chapter (Chapter 3: C) are also mixtures. However, the mineral coatings on the surfaces of the rock samples may be optically thick and obscure the spectral signatures of the underlying minerals.<br>\n<br>\nFrozen water, in the form of snow and ice, is included in Chapter 4: L.<br>\n<br>\nOrganic compounds are a vast category with great chemical diversity. We have added more than 200 organic compounds to a new chapter in this release of the library (Chapter 5: O). The additions are focused on compounds of smaller molecular weight that form the functional groups for larger molecules. Major groups represented include alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, aromatic hydrocarbons based on the benzene ring, and amino acids. Many of these compounds are known by multiple names because of different naming conventions and use of the common name before systematic naming conventions were created. We endeavored to use the name that was in most common use in the spectrum titles. The sample description has the Chemical Abstract Services Registry Number. The metadata descriptions also list the various names that have been applied to a particular chemical. Biochemical constituents of plants are also in this chapter of the library. Spectra of major components of plants, including lignin, cellulose, amylose, and starch, and less abundant components, including many plant phenolics, were added.<br>\n<br>\nTerrestrial remote sensing may be used in urban areas covered by manmade materials, so the library includes spectra of plastics, roofing materials, processed wood, paint, and other artificial materials (Chapter 6: A). Also in this chapter are materials that might be considered natural, for example oil and vermiculite insulation; however, they are present in the environment because of human activity or they have been altered or concentrated during a manufacturing process. In the data release, spectra of oil residues from the British Petroleum (BP) Deepwater Horizon spill (DWH) have been added. Materials that we use to process spectra and monitor the performance of our spectrometers have been added, specifically, Spectralon and mylar plastic.<br>\n<br>\nThe spectra in the vegetation chapter (Chapter 7: V) are representative of areas in which we have conducted research and for which we have published results, including: grasslands, semiarid shrublands, biological soil crusts, temperate evergreen forests, California chaparral, and coastal wetlands. The spectra span a range of measurement scales, from laboratory spectra of leaves, stems, flowers, and other plant components to remotely-sensed spectra of vegetated areas of mixed species. Because the SPECPR database file format has a limitation of 40 characters for spectrum titles, scientific names of organisms are rarely used in spectrum titles. Instead, scientific names are specified in the metadata descriptions of spectra. Spectra of leaves or a plant of a single species are often listed by a generic common name of the plant (for example, “manzanita” to represent <em>Arctostaphylos viscida<\u002fem> Parry). Field and AVIRIS spectra of mixed vegetation areas (plant communities) are sometimes listed by the common name of the dominant species (for example, lodgepole pine), by biome (such as grassland or shrubland), or by a land-use term (such as rangeland). In some cases, the title contains the biome name and the dominant species indicated by symbols comprising the genus and species of the dominant plant, for example, “Marsh_SPAL80%...” in the title describing a coastal wetland area where the most abundant species is <em>Spartina alterniflora<\u002fem> Loisel. with 80 percent (%) cover.<br>\n<br>\nAny use of trade, firm, or product names is for descriptive purposes only and does not imply endorsement by the U.S. Government.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>References:<\u002fstrong><br>\n<br>\nBarsi, J.
